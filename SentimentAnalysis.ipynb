    "1. #Data Collection\n",
    "Gather employee feedback data, which may be in the form of open-ended survey responses, comments, \n",
    "or reviews.\n",
    "#Ensure the data is in a structured format (e.g., a CSV file) with each piece of feedback clearly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step2 Text Preprocessing\n",
    "Text Cleaning: Clean the text data to remove any noise. This may include:\n",
    "Lowercasing the text to ensure uniformity.\n",
    "Removing special characters, numbers, and punctuation.\n",
    "Eliminating stop words (common words that add little value to sentiment analysis, like \"and,\" \"the,\" \"is,\" etc.).\n",
    "Performing stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\").\n",
    "Also tokenization \n",
    "\n",
    " Step3 Feature Extraction\n",
    "Convert the cleaned text into a format suitable for analysis. Common methods include:\n",
    "Bag-of-Words (BoW): Represents text data as a set of words with their respective frequencies.\n",
    "Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Similar to BoW, but it adjusts the word frequencies based on their occurrence across the entire dataset to emphasize more informative words.\n",
    "Word Embeddings: Use techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe to capture semantic meaning through dense vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step4 Model Selection\n",
    "Choose a sentiment analysis model or approach. Options include:\n",
    "Lexicon-based Approaches: Utilize predefined dictionaries of words labeled with sentiment scores (e.g., AFINN, VADER) to score the sentiment of feedback.\n",
    "Machine Learning Approaches: Train models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines) on labeled datasets to classify feedback as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
    "Deep Learning Approaches: Use neural networks, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT), for more sophisticated sentiment classification.\n",

    "\"I love the two-pot system; it gives me more flexibility.\"\tPositive\n",
    "\"I find the two-pot system confusing and hard to navigate.\"\tNegative\n",
    "\"The two-pot system is in place as of January 2024.\"\tNeutral\n",
    "\"It feels like my savings are at risk with this new policy.\"\tNegative\n",
    "\"The new policy has greatly improved my financial planning.\"\tPositive\n",
    "\"I have some questions about how the policy works.\"\tNeutral\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "By systematically analyzing the feedback based on the outlined categories, you can effectively classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into employee perceptions of the two-pot system. If you have specific pieces of feedback youâ€™d like categorized, please share, and I can help categorize them accordingly.\n",
